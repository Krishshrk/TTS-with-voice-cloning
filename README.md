# Voice Cloning with Tortoise Model

## Introduction

Text-to-speech with voice cloning is an exciting and innovative technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate. It allows us to create highly realistic and personalized digital voices that can be used for various applications, including narrating audio books, video games, providing customer support, and creating personalized voiceover recordings. With voice cloning, we can capture the unique characteristics of a person's voice and replicate it accurately, resulting in digital voices that sound just like their real-life counterparts. This technology bridges the gap between human and machine communication.

In this repository, we provide instructions on how to use the Tortoise model in PyTorch for voice cloning. Tortoise is a multi-speaker model that relies on reference clips to guide the generation of speech, determining properties such as pitch, tone, speaking speed, and even speech defects like lisps or stuttering.

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the Tortoise model for voice cloning, you'll need to follow these steps:

### 1. Gather Audio Clips

To clone a specific person's voice, you must collect audio recordings of that person. Good sources for these clips include:

- YouTube interviews (you can use `youtube-dl` to fetch the audio)
- Audiobooks
- Podcasts

Make sure to gather a variety of clips to capture the full range of the speaker's voice.

### 2. Segment Your Clips

After gathering the audio clips, you should cut them into approximately 10-second segments. It's recommended to have at least three such segments to train the model effectively.

### 3. Save Clips as WAV Files

Save the segmented clips as WAV files with the following specifications:

- Format: Floating point
- Sample Rate: 22,050 Hz

### 4. Create a Subdirectory

In your project directory, create a subdirectory named `voices`.

### 5. Organize Your Clips

Place the WAV files you've created in the `voices` subdirectory you just created. Each subdirectory in the `voices` directory corresponds to a different speaker.

### 6. Running Tortoise Utilities

To add new voices to Tortoise, run the Tortoise utilities with the following command, specifying the `<your_subdirectory_name>` as the subdirectory where you've placed the audio clips:

```bash
python tortoise_utilities.py --voice=<your_subdirectory_name>
```

Tortoise will use the reference clips to generate speech in the style of the speaker you've added.

## Guidelines for Good Clips

When gathering audio clips for voice cloning, consider the following guidelines:

- Choose clips where the speaker's voice is clear and distinct.
- Select a variety of clips that represent different tones, emotions, and speaking styles.
- Ensure the audio quality is high, with minimal background noise.
- Aim for at least three 10-second clips of the same speaker.

## Conclusion

Voice cloning with the Tortoise model in PyTorch is a powerful technology that enables the creation of highly realistic and personalized digital voices. By following the steps outlined in this readme, you can add new voices to the Tortoise model and leverage its capabilities for various applications. We hope this technology revolutionizes the way we communicate and interact with technology, bringing us closer to bridging the gap between human and machine communication.
